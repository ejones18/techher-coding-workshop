# Chapter 4 - The programming challenges / projects!

This is it! Well done on your work thus far; it's now time to put what you've learnt towards the creation of your own mini-project! This module offers guidance on how to create and run a Python file in Visual Studio Code as well as a selection of projects for you to sink your teeth into!

## Working in a team

### Using the LiveShare extension to work in a team
As part of the pre-requisites, we asked participants to download the LiveShare extension which allows for remote collaboration within Visual Studio Code. Should you wish to work with another person on the challenges, follow these steps!

1. One person needs to naviagte to the LiveShare extension within Visual Studio Code - Looking for the big arrow on the far left taskbar, this will open the LiveShare options.
2. Hit `Share` and then preceed to sign-in with your github account - this will take you to aweb-page where you can authorise the connection.
3. You may be prompted to update your firewall settings here, if so hit `Next` and you should receive a pop-up box in the bottom right of VS Code saying you have copied the invitation link - this will need to be shared with your team.
4. The other person will follow step 1, but this time hit `Join` and paste the link sent to them by the other person that followed the above steps
5. Viola, after a few seconds you should be there! You'll be able to code alongside one another!

### Using Microsoft Teams
If LiveShare isn't working for you, you can create a Microsoft Teams call for you and your team to join. In the call you can share your screen (icon in the top right-hand corner) and discuss your solution together!
